This notebook presents data analysis for my graduate thesis, 'Fused Silica Cherenkov Detector Response to MeV Photons'. 
The project investigated the quartz Cherenkov radiation detector's response to a monoenergetic photon beam in ~15MeV to 55 MeV energy ranging. 
The efficiency defined the response characteristics by calculating the fraction of events interacted with the quartz detector. 
Detailed physics theories, experiment setup, analysis, and conclusion of this study can be find in my graduate thesis published in the following link:
